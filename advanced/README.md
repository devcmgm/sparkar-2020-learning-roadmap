<h2>What is AR ?</h2>
<p>
Augmented reality allows us to create content that includes new layers of context, meaning, and emotion. It delivers experiences that blur the lines between the head and the heart. It builds bridges between the here-and-now. It helps us see the world in greater depth, and gives us new ways to reveal our authentic selves.
